Project Overview:- Conducted an end-to-end exploratory data analysis on customer, order, delivery, and completion datasets across a 9-month window to derive actionable business intelligence. The objective was to identify key operational trends, optimize logistics, and improve marketing and customer engagement strategies for a fictional e-commerce delivery-based platform.

Key Responsibilities & Achievements:
Analyzed order distribution across time slots and delivery areas, uncovering that HSR Layout and afternoon slots had the highest order volumes.
Investigated temporal trends in delivery charges and discounts, identifying that late-night deliveries incur the highest charges, while August witnessed peak discounts.
Ranked areas by growth in order volume, revealing HSR Layout as the leading contributor with over 15,000+ orders, while several areas had minimal engagement.
Calculated discount and delivery charges as a percentage of product amount, offering insights into cost optimization and revenue leak points.
Mapped completion rates by weekday/slot and region, identifying 100% completion patterns on specific days (e.g., Sunday evenings, Wednesday late nights).
Segmented customers by acquisition source and lifetime value (LTV), revealing that organic platforms brought the most valuable users while Instagram drove high churn.
Discovered behavioral patterns, such as high-rated orders aligning with late-night deliveries and bulk orders, aiding in customer experience strategies.
Evaluated delivery times at multiple granularities (by area, time slot, and weekday/weekend) to expose inefficiencies in Brookfield, Mahadevapura, and other congested zones.

Techniques: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Segmentation, KPI Tracking, Trend Analysis, Completion Rate & LTV Calculation, Time-Series Interpretation

Soft Skills: Business Acumen, Critical Thinking, Insight Communication, Data Storytelling
